DISCLAIMER
Append here everything we do in one working session.
I think it's a better approach than writing the readme in GIT. (we can them keep both anyway)

  - not sure how is the best: "to let the services call the url /callback/service/{service_name}" OR to call authenticate/callback/{service_name}. 
    Probably better with the later one because I already have the auth_{service_name} model created and I kust need to add teh callback function.
  
  - to do: add a {reqest_access_token} method in authenticate
  
  - to do: change /service/ from the URL below to something like authenticate/{request_temp_token}/{service_name}
  
  - manage to set the link /authenticate/service/{service_name} to redirect to the service name and be redirectede to the callback url with the code (only instagram for now tested)

  - added the Auth_abstract model with its subclasses Auth_{service_name} 

  - added the core/Anonym_controller - to load whenever a anonymous is browsing the site. to be implemented later

  - added the core/Cron_controller - to load from it whenever CRON is working and doesn't need log in
  
  - added the core/User_controller - to load from it whenever we want to check if it's logged in

  - changed .center to .grid
  
  - took the <div class="center">{content}</div> out of each component and put it page. Try to stay as DRY here as we can.
