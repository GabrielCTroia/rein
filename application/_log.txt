DISCLAIMER
Append here everything we do in one working session.
I think it's a better approach than writing the readme in GIT. (we can them keep both anyway)

  - changed .center to .grid
  
  - took the <div class="center">{content}</div> out of each component and put it page. Try to stay as DRY here as we can.
