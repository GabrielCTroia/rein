DISCLAIMER

This guide should explain the composition decisions we make down the road
and give a better perspective of the whole structure of the app.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Controllers:
  
  Every Controller loads a common index.php which loads a specific
  page ( home.php , splash.php , callback.php , connect.php ...) 
  which also loads specifc components ( sign-up.php , login.php , feed.php , settings.php ... )
  among with the page specific includes ( header.php , footer.php ) 
  
  
  {Ghost} Component = A component which doesn't have a view assgined to it
                      It mostly only redirects you to another URL where you actually load a view
                      The difference between a Ghost Component and a method is that you actually use it as a URL
